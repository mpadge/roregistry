Binder is a \n    easy interface to produce a virtual machine within which to rerun analyses without requiring \n    installation or understanding of underlying containerisation principles. It does however still require \n    researchers to search through their code to find packages and version of packages used in the project. \n    This package seeks to make the bridge to using binder for analyses in R even simpler, by setting up\n    the install.R file with all packages and version (both on CRAN and github) in one step. \n    The binder can also be launched right from R, without needing to manually input repository information\n    into the mybinder.org interface.

Although our initial motivation \n    was to provide functions to analyze work loop experiment data, as we \n    developed the package we incorporated the ability to analyze data from \n    experiments that are often complementary to work loops. There are currently \n    three supported experiment types: work loops, simple twitches, and tetanus \n    trials. Data can be imported directly from .ddf files or via an object \n    constructor function. Through either method, data can then be cleaned or \n    transformed via methods typically used in studies of muscle physiology. \n    Data can then be analyzed to determine the timing and magnitude of force \n    development and relaxation (for isometric trials) or the magnitude of work, \n    net power, and instantaneous power among other things (for work loops). \n    Although we do not provide plotting functions, all resultant objects are \n    designed to be friendly to visualization via either base-R plotting or \n    'tidyverse' functions.\n This package has been peer-reviewed by rOpenSci (v. 1.1.0).",
