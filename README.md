To get stats (CRAN details, downloads, GitHub stats, etc.) on rOpenSci pkgs check out the package [rostats](https://github.com/ropensci/rostats)

To get just the raw JSON of the registry, go to [https://ropensci.github.io/roregistry/registry.json](https://ropensci.github.io/roregistry/registry.json)
